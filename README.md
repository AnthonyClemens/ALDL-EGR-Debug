A Java application used to go through an ALDL log, for EGR Debugging on GM OBD-1 ECU's. WinALDL is used to create the logfiles compatible with this program found at https://winaldl.joby.se/. This code was tested on a 1227170 ecu out of an '88 Fiero Formula. 
To run, move the .jar or .exe file to the directory that you have your logfiles stored in and run `java -jar ALDLEGRDebug.jar` or ALDLEGRDebug.exe and you will be prompted to either select a file to analyze or quit.
